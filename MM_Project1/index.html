        <h1>My Icons for Project 1</h1>

        <h2>Applications, Features, and Interface Icons</h2>

        <div class="container"><div class="one">
            <h3>Simple, strategic, geometric, triangles, alternation.</h3>
            <p>Google Drive for iphone. I like the geometric design as well as the possibilities 
                when it comes to animating the photo.
                When I think about motion I think about the way that it could be pulsating. 
                The element of design that I think of when I think of this is visual hierarchy 
                as well as foreground and background. Pulsating the image will cause this to be altered.
                My 5 keywords to describe the application is: Simple, strategic, geometric, triangles, alternation.
                .</p>

        <div class="two">
            <img src="images/icondrive1.gif">
        </div>

        <div class="three">
            <h3>Iconic, rectangular, important, simple, soft.</h3>
            <p>The feature that I choose is the ‘menu’ button feature. It is the only way to make 
                your way out of the home page of the application.
                The motions that come to mind when I think of this feature are the back and forth 
                movements of the three lines, all alternating each other.
                My 5 keywords to describe the application is: Iconic, rectangular, important, simple, 
                soft.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="four"><img src="images/iconmenu2.gif"></div>

        <div class="five">
            <h3>Abstract, simple, literal, geometric, empty.</h3>
            <p>The interface I choose is the ‘trash’ interface. The main reason I chose it is 
                because of the endless possibilities of animating a trash can.
                This interface indicates the motion of putting a file into the trash and deleting 
                it forever. It is different because it signifies the action of editing a file location completely.
                My 5 keywords to describe this interface is: abstract, simple, literal, geometric, empty.</p>
