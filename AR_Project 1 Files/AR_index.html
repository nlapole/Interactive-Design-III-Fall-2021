						<h3>Application</h3>
						<p>For this project I chose to animate the clock app.  Its an app I personally use quite a bit, and its visual design 
						has always been minimalist and elegant.  In this animation, I capture its sense of simplicity, showing no more information 
						than in neccessary to convey its purpose.</p>

					<h3>Feature</h3>
					<p>
						Within the clock app, users can set alarms for any time of day.  The panel to represent this is an old analogue alarm clock, a clever
						little instance of skeuomorphism.  When animating this element, I took inspiration from old cartoons which had these 
						erratic animations for alarm clocks where it jumps in the air and shakes wildly.</p>

					<h3>Interface</h3>
					<p>For being such a simple element, there is a lot of subtle design in the animation of a switch.  Its simple, but always is effective
					at conveying the desired information, which in this case is the activation state of any given alarm.  My version doesn't feature the 
					color shift used in Apple's sliders, but the rest is there.  Its a simple animation, but it gets the job done.'</p>
