        <h1> Project 1 for ID3</h3>
        <h2> Produced by B-Money</h2>

            <div class="one">
                <h2>Helpful. Handy. Easy. Sleek. Compact.</h2>
                <p>The app I chose is the Spotify app. I like the sleek green and black/grey design of the app icon. The simplicity is another reason why I really like the icon’s design. 
                    I think a simple animation that would be interesting would be the three curved bars slowly fading in one by one and then either leaving it static or having it do a minimal shake at the end when they’re all in the right place.

            <div class="three">

                <h2>Round. Simplistic. Attentive. Useful. Intuitive.</h2>
                <p> I chose the search feature within the Spotify app. I picked it because that’s the main reason I use Spotify now. The search/curation of playlists for you from Spotify are good. I use Spotify every day all the time. I’m not sure of exactly what motions but my music taste is very like soft and chill songs, and I associate those vibes with like curvy and slow motions.  -shakespeare</p>

            </div>

            <div class="five">

                <h2>Unique. Cool. Good marketing (This is one word, I promise). Social. Round.</h2>
                <p> The scan function of the search feature is such a cool idea for Spotify. It’s icon itself is just a basic camera but once again simplified as all of Spotify’s icons are. It doesn’t really have a secondary icon, but it pulls up the camera to scan the Spotify code. </p>
